  long: |
    Haven is a specialized Nostr relay system that provides a complete infrastructure
    for managing your Nostr presence. It consists of five interconnected relay components:

    - Private Relay: Secure storage for drafts and sensitive content
    - Chat Relay: Direct messaging with web-of-trust validation
    - Inbox Relay: Centralized location for mentions and tags
    - Outbox Relay: Public-facing storage for your posts
    - Blossom Media Server: Image and video content hosting

    Configure your relay settings through Start9's native configuration interface
    and connect to the Nostr network seamlessly.
